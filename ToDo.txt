To Do:
- Change cursor of all buttons to pointer
- Add a sort function on lists
	* Sort by price, max occupancy when displaying a list of available rooms to reserve/add to to an existing reservation
	* Sort by first name, last name, check in, check out
- Realistic descriptions and images for rooms
- Add amentities attribute to rooms, display on reservations page and details page
- Change Room Service/Dine/Spa buttons on guest reservation details page so there is no POST/GET
- Create reservations for class presentation (a few reservations with current check ins/check outs, open reservations, open messages)



Finished:
- Do not allow guest to remove rooms once the reservation has been checked in (but staff may do so, and guest may still add rooms while checked in)
- Do not allow guest to cancel a reservation once the reservation has been checked in (but staff may do so).
- Do not allow guest to change the check out date to a sooner date once the reservation has been checked in (but staff may do so).
- Price charged when adding a room now reflects the correct price (between today and check out) if the reservation has been checked in
- Added a balance to reservation details on staff view
- When modifying check in/out for staff view, pre-fill the check in/out dates with the reservation's check in/out dates
- Re-size the modify check in/out date forms on the staff view to match the modify check in/out date forms on the guest view
- Add a search of all open/current reservations to staff view(ie those checked in but that have not been checked out)
- Shorten input fields in Search Reservation page for staff view
- When searching for a reservation under staff view, names/emails should not be case-sensitive
- Convert all date objects from UTC to local time
- Use Check in time, Check out time reservation details page
- Add/Remove guest functionality, if there is enough time
